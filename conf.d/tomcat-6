# JVM Runtime
# Using the default setting, it will determine your JVM from the system-vm
# set using java-config.
# See java-config(1) manual page for assistance in determining this value.
#
# You can override this value with whatever path you wish.  
# Example: export GENTOO_VM="sun-jdk-1.6"

#export GENTOO_VM="sun-jdk-1.6"

# (Optional) Java runtime options used when the "start", "stop", or "run"
# commands are executed.
# Example to set library path for tomcat-native
# JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib"
# JAVA_OPTS=""

# Where your web applications are located
CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/tomcat-6/
CATALINA_BASE=/var/lib/tomcat-6/

# Tomcat's User/Group
# Change these at your own risk!!! These are not supported so if it 
# breaks something, you are on your own.
CATALINA_USER=tomcat
CATALINA_GROUP=tomcat

# Location of the Tomcat JARs and classes
CATALINA_LIBDIR=/usr/share/tomcat-6/lib/

# The CLASSPATH for Tomcat to use, plus any others you need.
CLASSPATH=${CATALINA_LIBDIR}

# (Optional) Directory path location of temporary directory the JVM should 
# use (java.io.tmpdir).  Defaults to $CATALINA_BASE/temp.
CATALINA_TMPDIR="/var/tmp/tomcat-6/"

# TOMCAT STARTUP/SHUTDOWN
# 	debug             Start Catalina in a debugger
# 	-security debug   Debug Catalina with a security manager

# 	start             Start Catalina in a separate window
# 	-security start   Start in a separate window with security manager
