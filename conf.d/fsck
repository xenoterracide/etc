# Pass any arguments to fsck.
# By default we preen.
# Linux systems also force -C0 and -T.
# If fsck_args is not specified then Linux systems also use -A
# (and -R if / is rw)
#fsck_args="-p"

# We can also specify the passno in /etc/fstab to check
# If you multiplex fsck (ie ln -s fsck /etc/init.d/fsck.late) then you can
# do an fsck outside of the normal scope, say for /home.
# Here are some exampes:-
#fsck_passno="=1 =2"
#fsck_passno=">1"
#fsck_passno="<2"

# fsck_shutdown causes fsck to trigger during shutdown as well as startup.
# The end result of this is that if any periodic non-root filesystem checks are
# scheduled, under normal circumstances the actual check will happen during
# shutdown rather than at next boot.
# This is useful when periodic filesystem checks are causing undesirable
# delays at startup, but such delays at shutdown are acceptable.
fsck_shutdown="NO"
