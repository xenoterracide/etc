#%name 30 - HTTP policy enforcement
#%desc The HTTP policy enforcement rule set sets limitations on the use of HTTP by clients.

# Few applications require the breadth and depth of the HTTP protocol. On the 
# other hand many attacks abuse valid but rare HTTP use patterns. Restricting 
# HTTP protocol usage is effective in therefore effective in blocking many 
# application layer attacks. 
#
# TODO If you are using the ModSecurity Core Ruleset template system you can set 
#      the policy limitations in the ruleset.config file. Otherwise edit this 
#      file manually to set you policy limitations.
#
# TODO Many automation programs use non standard HTTP requests. While you may 
#      want to allow some of those, try not to create exceptions only for the
#      automated program based on properties such as their source IP address or
#      the URL they access.

# allow request methods
#
# TODO Most applications only use GET, HEAD, and POST request
#      methods, if so uncomment the line below. Otherwise you are advised 
#      to edit the line before uncommenting it.

# Restrict which content-types we accept.
#
# TODO Most applications support only two types for request bodies
#      because that is all browsers know how to produce. If you are using
#      automated tools to talk to the application you may be using other
#      content types and would want to change the list of supported types.
# 
#      Note though that ModSecurity parses only three content types:
#      application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data request and 
#      text/xml. The protection provided for any other type is inferior.
#
# TODO There are many applications that are not using multipart/form-data
#      types (typically only used for file uploads). This content type
#      can be disabled if not used.  
#
# NOTE We allow any content type to be specified with GET or HEAD
#      because some tools incorrectly supply content type information
#      even when the body is not present. There is a rule further in
#      the file to prevent GET and HEAD requests to have bodies to we're
#      safe in that respect.
#
# NOTE Use of WebDAV requires "text/xml" content type.
#
# NOTE Philippe Bourcier (pbourcier AT citali DOT com) reports
#      applications running on the PocketPC and AvantGo platforms use
#      non-standard content types:

## -- Apache Limits ----------------------------------------------------------

# These are Apache limit directives, but we are including them here because
# they are often forgotten. If you already have these configured leave this
# section entirely commented-out. Otherwise review the limits and uncomment
# the directives.

# Maximum size of the request body.
#
# NOTE If your application allows file uploads the value below will
#      most likely be way to low.
#
#LimitRequestBody 64000

# Maximum number of request headers in a request.
#
#LimitRequestFields 32

# Maximum size of request header lines.
#
#LimitRequestFieldSize 8000

# Maximum size of the request line.
#
#LimitRequestLine 4000
